## The Value of Near-Real-Time Monitoring
- [Scenario: Online Cart Abandonment](#scenario-online-cart-abandonment)
- [Key Metrics and KPIs](#key-metrics-and-kpis)
- [Value of BI in Real-Time Decision Making](#value-of-bi-in-real-time-decision-making)

### Scenario: Online Cart Abandonment
- Example: Many online shoppers add items to their cart but don’t complete the purchase. This behavior results in abandoned carts, leading to an estimated $18 billion in lost revenue annually, according to Shopify.
- BI Professional’s Role: By analyzing customer journey data, BI professionals can identify where and why shoppers abandon their carts, offering actionable insights for improvement.

### Key Metrics and KPIs
- Metrics:
    - Definition: Quantifiable data points that measure specific aspects of performance, such as page load speed.
    - Example: Monitoring how fast the checkout page loads; if slow, it might prompt site improvements to reduce abandonment rates.
- KPIs (Key Performance Indicators):
    - Definition: Strategic metrics closely tied to business goals, measuring progress toward those goals.
    - Example KPIs for an e-commerce site:
        - Average transaction value
        - Customer retention rate
        - Year-over-year sales
    - Difference from Metrics: Metrics are tactical and support KPIs, which are strategic and support overall business objectives.
- Strategy vs. Tactic:
    - Strategy: A high-level plan for achieving long-term goals (e.g., reducing cart abandonment by 15% in six months).
    - Tactic: Actions and methods taken to achieve the strategic goals (e.g., optimizing page load speed).
- BI Monitoring
    - Purpose: Involves creating tools to monitor relevant metrics/KPIs in real-time or near real-time, helping stakeholders make prompt, informed decisions.
    - Example: A BI tool tracking page load speed for checkout could alert the team to slowdowns, enabling them to address the issue before it impacts more customers.

### Value of BI in Real-Time Decision Making
- Rapid monitoring allows BI tools to immediately detect issues like increased abandoned carts, low inventory, or spikes in customer service calls. 
- Addressing these promptly can prevent further negative impact, adding tangible value to the organization.

BI professionals enhance e-commerce operations by translating data into insights, monitoring key metrics and KPIs, and supporting both strategic and tactical improvements. Through rapid monitoring and real-time response, they enable decision-makers to act swiftly, ensuring smoother customer experiences and driving business success.

## The Evolution of AI: Traditional AI vs. Generative AI
### Traditional AI Workflow
1. **Repository**
    - A centralized storage for organizational data
    - Can include structured (tables, columns, rows) or unstructured data (images, documents)
2. **Analytics Platform**
    - Tools like SPSS Modeler or Watson Studio
    - Data from the repository is used here to build predictive models
3. **Application Layer**
    - Hosts the models for business use cases
    - Example: Predict customer churn and take actions to prevent it
4. **Feedback Loop**
    - Key to making Traditional AI systems adaptive
    - Improves models based on successes or mistakes (e.g. learning from incorrect churn predictions)
### GenAI Workflow
1. **Data Source**
    - Data is not confined to an organization's repository, but comes from a massive global dataset
    - Incorporates diverse information from broad domains (e.g., "data from earth")
2. **Large Language Models (LLMs)**
    - Built on vast quantities of generative data
    - Highly powerful and flexible, but lacks specificity for individual business use cases
3. **Prompting and Tuning**
    - Bridges the gap between general knowledge in LLMs and business-specific requirements
    - Fine-tunes models for nuanced and organization-specific applications (e.g., understanding idiosyncratic customer chrun factors)
4. **Application Layer**
    - Similar to traditional AI, where models are deployed for practical use.
5. **Feedback Loop**
    - Focuses on refining the propmpting and tuning layer rather than the models themselves
### Key Differences
- **Data Scope**: Traditional AI uses organization-specific data; GenAI leverages massive, global datasets
- **Model Size**: GenAI involves significantly larger models (e.g., LLMs)
- **Architecture**: GenAI requires a new paradigm due to the scale of data and models, which surpasses what can be stored in traditional repositories
### Summary
GenAI fundamentally differs from traditional AI in its reliance on vast, diverse datasets and large scale models. While traditional AI is centered around Predictive analytics with a feedback loop for continuous learning, GenAI incorporates prompting and tuning to tailor massive, generalized models to specific business needs

### Overview
Machine Learning (ML), a subset of artificial intelligence, enables machines to learn from datasets and past experiences to recognize patterns and make predictions. ML has become a major part of daily life and is projected to grow into a $200 billion industry by 2029.
### Ten Key Use Cases of Machine Learning
1. **Customer Service**
    - **Chatbots**: Handle text-based queries, resolve issues, or route customers to human agents
    - **Voice Assistants**: Tools like Siri and Alexa use speech-to-text and NLP models to process spoken commands
2. **Auto-Transcription**
    - Services like Slack and YouTube use ML to transcribe spoken words in video content in text
3. **Mobile Apps**
    - **Recommendations**: Apps like Spotfiy and LinkedIn use ML for personalized suggestions (e.g., songs, job oppotunities)
    - **Image Search**: ML powers on-device image classification, enabling users to quickly locate specific photos (e.g., finding a photo of a pet)
4. **Smartphones**
    - **Computational Photography**: Enhances images with features like background blur in selfies
    - **Facial Recognition**: Unlocks devices securely
5. **Financial Transactions**
    - **Fraud Detection**: Trains models to flag suspicious credit card transaction, processing over 150 million transactions daily in the US
    - **Stock Market Trading**: ML algorithms account for 60% - 73% of all trades, increasing annually
6. **Cybersecurity**
    - Reinforcement learning models identify and respond to cyberattacks and detect intrusions effectively
7. **Transportation**
    - **Google Maps**: ML evaluates traffic conditions and determines the fastest route
    - **Ride-Sharing**: Apps like Uber and Lyft use ML for rider-driver matching and route optimization
8. **Email Filtering**
    - ML models classify incoming messages (e.g., spam filtering) and provide autocomplete responses
9. **Healthcare**
    - **Radiology**: ML enhances accuracy in detecting tumors, bone fractures, and early cancer screenings from medical images
    - **Efficency**: Speeds up radiologists' workflows by flagging suspicious cases for focused attention
10. **Marketing and Sales**
    - **Personalization**: Marketers use ML for lead generation, analytics, and search engine optimization
    - **Targeted Campaigns**: Build on recommendation algorithms (e.g., Netflix-style suggestions) for personalized marketing campaigns tailored to user preferences
### Key Benefits of ML
1. **Pattern Recognition**: Excels in analyzing and classifying large datasets
2. **Efficiency**: Automates tasks and reduces human workload
3. **Personalization**: Delivers tailored experiences (e.g., recommendations, marketing)
4. **Proactivity**: Enables fraud detection and preventative healthcare measures
5. **Scalability**: Handles vast amounts of data (e.g., finanical institutions, user queries)
### Conclusion
Machine Learning is no longer theoretical—it is an integral part of daily life, from personalized recommendations to advanced medical imaging. As ML continues to evolve, its applications will expand further, reshaping industries and driving innovation.

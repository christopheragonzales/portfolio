## The Evolution of AI: Traditional AI vs. Generative AI
### Traditional AI Workflow
1. **Repository**
    - A centralized storage for organizational data
    - Can include structured (tables, columns, rows) or unstructured data (images, documents)
2. **Analytics Platform**
    - Tools like SPSS Modeler or Watson Studio
    - Data from the repository is used here to build predictive models
3. **Application Layer**
    - Hosts the models for business use cases
    - Example: Predict customer churn and take actions to prevent it
4. **Feedback Loop**
    - Key to making Traditional AI systems adaptive
    - Improves models based on successes or mistakes (e.g. learning from incorrect churn predictions)
### GenAI Workflow
1. **Data Source**
    - Data is not confined to an organization's repository, but comes from a massive global dataset
    - Incorporates diverse information from broad domains (e.g., "data from earth")
2. **Large Language Models (LLMs)**
    - Built on vast quantities of generative data
    - Highly powerful and flexible, but lacks specificity for individual business use cases
3. **Prompting and Tuning**
    - Bridges the gap between general knowledge in LLMs and business-specific requirements
    - Fine-tunes models for nuanced and organization-specific applications (e.g., understanding idiosyncratic customer chrun factors)
4. **Application Layer**
    - Similar to traditional AI, where models are deployed for practical use.
5. **Feedback Loop**
    - Focuses on refining the propmpting and tuning layer rather than the models themselves
### Key Differences
- **Data Scope**: Traditional AI uses organization-specific data; GenAI leverages massive, global datasets
- **Model Size**: GenAI involves significantly larger models (e.g., LLMs)
- **Architecture**: GenAI requires a new paradigm due to the scale of data and models, which surpasses what can be stored in traditional repositories
### Summary
GenAI fundamentally differs from traditional AI in its reliance on vast, diverse datasets and large scale models. While traditional AI is centered around Predictive analytics with a feedback loop for continuous learning, GenAI incorporates prompting and tuning to tailor massive, generalized models to specific business needs

## The Evolution of AI: Traditional AI vs. Generative AI
### Traditional AI Workflow
1. **Repository**
    - A centralized storage for organizational data
    - Can include structured (tables, columns, rows) or unstructured data (images, documents)
2. **Analytics Platform**
    - Tools like SPSS Modeler or Watson Studio
    - Data from the repository is used here to build predictive models
3. **Application Layer**
    - Hosts the models for business use cases
    - Example: Predict customer churn and take actions to prevent it
4. **Feedback Loop**
    - Key to making Traditional AI systems adaptive
    - Improves models based on successes or mistakes (e.g. learning from incorrect churn predictions)
### GenAI Workflow
1. **Data Source**
    - Data is not confined to an organization's repository, but comes from a massive global dataset
    - Incorporates diverse information from broad domains (e.g., "data from earth")
2. **Large Language Models (LLMs)**
    - Built on vast quantities of generative data
    - Highly powerful and flexible, but lacks specificity for individual business use cases
3. **Prompting and Tuning**
    - Bridges the gap between general knowledge in LLMs and business-specific requirements
    - Fine-tunes models for nuanced and organization-specific applications (e.g., understanding idiosyncratic customer chrun factors)
4. **Application Layer**
    - Similar to traditional AI, where models are deployed for practical use.
5. **Feedback Loop**
    - Focuses on refining the propmpting and tuning layer rather than the models themselves
### Key Differences
- **Data Scope**: Traditional AI uses organization-specific data; GenAI leverages massive, global datasets
- **Model Size**: GenAI involves significantly larger models (e.g., LLMs)
- **Architecture**: GenAI requires a new paradigm due to the scale of data and models, which surpasses what can be stored in traditional repositories
### Summary
GenAI fundamentally differs from traditional AI in its reliance on vast, diverse datasets and large scale models. While traditional AI is centered around Predictive analytics with a feedback loop for continuous learning, GenAI incorporates prompting and tuning to tailor massive, generalized models to specific business needs

## Artifical Intelligence - Are We There Yet?
### What defines AI?
- **Definition**: Simulation of intelligent behavior in computers
- **Current Status**: Narrow AI (task-specific intelligence) exists, but Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) - equivalent to human intelligence - is not achieved yet.
### Examples of AI Milestones
1. **Arithmetic Calculations**
    - Example: Performing complex calcuations instantly
    - Conclusion: Impressive, but not indicative of intelligence; akin to using a calculator
2. **Memorization (e.g., Periodic Table)**
    - Example: Memorizing and recalling vast data accurately
    - Conclusion: More of a "database lookup" than true intelligence
3. **Chess Grandmaster**
    - Example: IBM's Deep Blue defeated the world's best chess player in 1997
    - Conclusion: Success in a narrowly defined domain, but still not an AGI
4. **The Turning Test**
    - **Definition**: A machine is considered intelligent if a user cannot distinguish between interacting with it or a human.
    - Example: In 2014, a chatbot simulating a 13-year-old boy arguably passed the Turning test
    - Conclusion: While impressive, the bar for true human-like intelligence remains high
### Challenges in Achieving AGI
- **Siloed Savants**: AI excels in specific tasks (e.g., arithmetic, memorization, chess), but lacks holistic human intelligence
- **Emotional Intelligence and Generalization**: True AGI requires a combination of emotional, cognitive, and general intelligence
- **Moving the Finish Line**: Each time AI achieves a milestone, the definition of "intelligence" evolves, pushing the goalposts further.
### Recent progress and the Future of AGI
- **Accelerated Development**
    - Recent years have seen rapid advancements, narrowing the gap toward AGI
    - Transitioning from siloed systems (e.g., Deep Blue) to multifuctional systems (e.g., ChatGPT)
- **AGI Outlook**
    - Still not achieved, but closer than ever
    - The development curve has steepened with progress accelerating faster than expected
### How AI is Used in Daily Life
- Self-driving cars: relies on AI for navigation and control
- Generating professional-quality photos through advanced prompting

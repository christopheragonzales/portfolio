## Projects

Each project in this repository is organized in its own directory and includes:
- **Data**: (if applicable) datasets or links to data sources used.
- **Code**: scripts and notebooks implementing data analysis, feature engineering, and modeling.
- **Results**: findings, visualizations, or key metrics from the analysis or model performance.

### Featured Projects

1. **[IBM HR Data Set: XGBoost Model to Predict Attrition](https://github.com/christopheragonzales/portfolio/tree/working_branch/ibm_hr_data)**
   - **Description**: Developed a predictive model to estimate the probability that an employee is likely to leave IBM using data from the IBM HR Data Set on Kaggle. Utilized an XGBoost model and Random Forest to address the inherent imbalance in the target variable.
   - **Highlights**: Data preprocessing, feature engineering, hyperparameter tuning, evaluation metrics.
   - **Skills Demonstrated**: Python, Scikit-Learn, XGBoost, Optuna.

## Installation
